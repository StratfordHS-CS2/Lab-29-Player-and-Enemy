# Lab 29 - Player and Enemy

In this lab you will be interacting with both a Player class and an Enemy class.  Think of this as the beginning of making a game.  

### Instructions

The Player class in `player.py` has many things wrong with it.  There is at least one thing wrong in each method, more in some methods.  Fix the Player class so that it works correctly.

Create the Enemy class in `enemy.py`.  Follow the directions in the file to create each method.

Use the code in `main.py` to test your classes.  You may modify and/or add to this code to make sure everything works well.

### Note

I am testing something new with GitHub Classroom so initially you will see a broken image at the top of this README.  That should be replaced with a status image once you commit and push back to GitHub.  Don't worry about it if it doesn't.  I may edit some of your repos to try and get it working if it doesn't work the first time.  

### Testing

After running your code you may run the automated tests.  Select either the 'Console' or 'Shell' tab and enter the command `pytest` to run the tests.

The tests do not test all aspects of the program.  Don't rely on passing all of the tests to mean you get a 100.
